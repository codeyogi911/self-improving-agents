# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project

A Claude Code skill called `/reflect` that analyzes session transcripts captured by Entire CLI. It extracts patterns (retry loops, research gaps, what worked, time sinks), produces structured reflections, and optionally bakes validated insights into CLAUDE.md or agent files.

## Structure

- `SKILL.md` — the skill definition file (frontmatter + workflow steps)
- `templates/reflection-format.md` — the output format template for reflections
- `README.md` — installation and usage docs
- `CLAUDE.md` — this file
- `evals/evals.json` — skill evaluation test cases

## Development

- Edit `SKILL.md` to change the analysis workflow
- Edit `templates/reflection-format.md` to change the reflection output format
- Test locally by symlinking:
  ```bash
  mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/reflect
  ln -sf $(pwd)/SKILL.md ~/.claude/skills/reflect/SKILL.md
  ln -sf $(pwd)/templates ~/.claude/skills/reflect/templates
  ```
- Invoke with `/reflect` in any project with Entire CLI sessions to test
- The skill reads templates at runtime, so changes to templates/ take effect immediately when symlinked
