  Answers questions about project history, past decisions, and how things
  evolved. Use this skill whenever the user asks "why" about code, files,
  architecture, or decisions — e.g., "why was this file deleted", "why did
  we switch to X", "what happened with Y", "who changed Z and why". Also
  use for retrospectives, post-mortems, understanding past sessions, learning
  from recent work, onboarding context ("what do I need to know about this
  repo"), and any question that is best answered by consulting git history
  or past AI session transcripts. Even if the user doesn't say "reflect" or
  "history" explicitly, if the answer lives in the past — use this skill.

  /reflect status, /reflect improve.

# Reflect — Repo-Owned Memory

You help users query and manage repo-owned memory for AI coding agents.
Reflect reads raw evidence from Entire CLI sessions and git history on demand
— no intermediate storage. A declarative `format.yaml` controls what sections
appear in the context briefing; a Claude subagent synthesizes high-quality
briefings with references. Live queries dump raw evidence for you to reason over.

Parse $ARGUMENTS to determine which command to run:

1. `search <query>` → go to **Command: Search**
2. `status` → go to **Command: Status**
3. `context` → go to **Command: Context**
4. `improve` → go to **Command: Improve**
5. Everything else (including no arguments) → go to **Command: Context**

---

## Command: Context (default)

Regenerate the context briefing:

```bash
reflect context
```

This gathers evidence from Entire CLI + git, passes it through the subagent
with the format config, validates output (citations, line budget), and writes
`context.md`. Falls back to deterministic rendering if Claude CLI is unavailable.

Report the result to the user: "Context briefing updated."

If the **SessionStart hook** output contains `REFLECT_AUTO_RUN`, run this
command automatically without user prompting. This keeps the briefing fresh.

---

## Command: Search

**Usage**: `/reflect search <query>`

```bash
reflect search <query>
```

Display the results to the user with source labels.

---

## Command: Status

**Usage**: `/reflect status`

```bash
reflect status
```

Display the output. If no evidence sources are found, suggest next steps.

---

## Command: Improve

**Usage**: `/reflect improve`

Analyzes context quality and proposes format.yaml changes. This is the self-improvement loop.

```bash
reflect improve
```

Read the full output. It contains:
1. **Context Quality Issues** — missing citations, truncation, empty sections
2. **Evidence Gaps** — signals in sessions that didn't make it into context
3. **Current format.yaml** — the section config to edit

Based on the analysis:
1. Propose specific edits to `.reflect/format.yaml` — add/remove/rename sections,
   adjust max_bullets, change recency windows
2. Show the user the diff and explain why each change helps
3. After approval, apply the edits and re-run `reflect context` to verify
4. Run `reflect improve` again to confirm the issues are resolved

**This is the core learning loop**: the format controls what gets synthesized,
the improve command evaluates quality against real evidence, and the user
tunes sections to match what their project actually needs.

## Digging Deeper

`context.md` is a briefing — a starting point, not the full story. When an entry
is relevant to your current task, spawn the **Keeper** agent to investigate.
Keeper searches context.md, runs `reflect search`, digs into raw checkpoints
via `entire explain`, and returns a sourced narrative.

Spawn Keeper when:
- A context.md entry relates to what you're about to change
- You need to trace a decision across multiple sessions
- You want to understand what was tried vs what landed
- An entry about pitfalls or reverted work is a STOP signal — let Keeper
  verify the constraint before you proceed

---

## Rules

- NEVER read `.entire/metadata/` directly — use `reflect` CLI or `entire` CLI
- To customize context, edit `.reflect/format.yaml` — add project-specific sections
- `.reflect/context.md` is generated — never edit it manually
- NEVER include secrets, API keys, or credentials in output
- **Pitfall/mistake entries are blocking**: if context.md lists a past mistake or revert
  for the area you're about to change, read the linked evidence BEFORE writing code
