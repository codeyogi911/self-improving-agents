  Scaffold a self-improving agentic harness into any project. Creates
  orchestrator, builder, verifier, e2e-tester, and researcher agents with
  iterative build loops, two-gate verification, gap tracking, and cross-session
  learning. Use when: user asks to set up self-improving agents, create an agent
  harness, add build loops, scaffold agent infrastructure, wants agents that
  learn from mistakes, or wants an iterative build-verify-test workflow.
  Also trigger when user mentions "build loop", "agent harness", "self-improving",
  or wants to add structured agent coordination to their project.

# Self-Improving Agents Harness

You are scaffolding a self-improving agentic harness into the user's project.
The harness runs iterative build loops — agents build, verify, test, and
improve, learning from each cycle and getting better across sessions.

If $ARGUMENTS is provided, use it as the initial goal.
If empty, scaffold in generic mode and ask the user for their goal afterward.

## Step 1: Deep Project Analysis

Don't just detect the stack — understand the project. The agents you create
should feel like they were written by someone who knows this codebase.

1. Read `CLAUDE.md` if it exists — understand project conventions
2. Detect stack by checking for: `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `Cargo.toml`,
   `go.mod`, `Gemfile`, `pom.xml`, `Makefile`
3. **Study the codebase** — this is what makes agents effective from day 1:
   - Scan directory structure with `ls` and `Glob`
   - Read 2-3 representative source files to understand code style, patterns,
     naming conventions, and architecture
   - Check test files: how are tests structured? What patterns do they follow?
     What test utilities exist?
   - Check for e2e test setup (Playwright, Cypress, Selenium, etc.)
   - Look at recent git history: what kind of changes are typical?
   - Note any CI/CD config (.github/workflows, .gitlab-ci.yml, etc.)
4. **Build a project profile** — you'll use this to customize every agent:
   - Language, framework, test runner, package manager, linter
   - Directory conventions (where does new code go? where do tests live?)
   - Key patterns (how are API routes defined? how is state managed? ORM?)
   - E2E framework or "none"
   - Common pitfalls visible from the code (e.g., complex build steps,
     environment-dependent tests, monorepo structure)
   - **Project type**: what kind of project is this? (see Agent Selection below)

### Agent Selection

Not every project needs all 5 agents. Decide which agents to create based on
what the project actually is:

**Always create:**
- **orchestrator** — every harness needs coordination
- **builder** — every project has code to write
- **verifier** — every project benefits from review

**Create only if relevant:**
- **e2e-tester** — only if the project has user-facing surfaces:
  - YES: web apps, APIs with endpoints, mobile apps, desktop apps, CLIs with
    interactive flows
  - NO: libraries, skills/plugins, config-only repos, documentation, pure
    data pipelines, markdown-only projects
- **researcher** — only if the project involves external dependencies or
  complex domains:
  - YES: apps using external APIs, projects with multiple frameworks,
    unfamiliar tech stacks, large codebases
  - NO: small single-file utilities, projects where everything is self-contained

**Consider creating project-specific agents** when the project has a clear
specialized need that none of the standard agents cover. Examples:
- **api-tester** for API-only projects (replaces e2e-tester with focused API
  contract testing)
- **migrator** for projects doing a major migration
- **docs-reviewer** for documentation-heavy projects
- **skill-evaluator** for Claude Code skill projects

Use the templates as a starting point, but adapt the role and instructions to
match the actual need. Give custom agents the same structure: Process section,
Output format, `## Project-Specific Rules`, `## Learnings`.

### Detect Existing Harness

5. Scan `.claude/` directory thoroughly:
   - `ls .claude/` and `ls .claude/agents/` if they exist
   - Check for symlinks (`ls -la .claude/`) — some projects link to external
     agent directories
   - Read each existing agent file to understand its purpose, format, and
     any knowledge it has accumulated

6. Classify into one of these scenarios:

   **A. Fresh project** — no `.claude/agents/` directory, or it exists but
   is empty (settings files don't count)
   → Full scaffolding with deep customization (Steps 2-5)

   **B. Our harness already installed** — `.claude/agents/` has files matching
   our structure (`## Project-Specific Rules`, `## Learnings` sections)
   → **Upgrade**: preserve all accumulated knowledge, refresh core instructions

   **C. Different agents exist** — `.claude/agents/` has agent files that
   don't match our templates (different structure, YAML format, or different
   names like `cap-developer.md`, `michael.md`)
   → **Fuse**: merge the best of both (see Fusion Protocol below)

   **D. External orchestration** — `.claude/` has symlinks to external agent
   directories, OR `config.yaml`/`AGENTS.md` registries indicating a
   higher-level orchestration system
   → **ESCALATE** to user with what you found. Ask whether to add alongside
   or skip.

7. Check for existing state files:
   - If `gaps.md` exists → **do NOT overwrite**
   - If `progress.md` exists → **do NOT overwrite**
   - If `run-journal.md` or similar tracking exists → note it, don't touch it

---

## Step 2: Create Directory Structure

```bash
mkdir -p .claude/agents
```

---

## Step 3: Write Agent Files

**Only create agents selected in Step 1.** The templates in `templates/` are
starting points, not finished products. Read each relevant template, then
customize it with real knowledge from the project analysis. If you decided to
create a custom agent (api-tester, skill-evaluator, etc.), use the closest
template as a base and adapt the role.

The skill's templates directory is at the same path as this SKILL.md file,
under `templates/`. Read each template file listed below.

### Scenario A — Fresh: Customize for This Project

For each **selected** agent, read the template from `templates/{agent}.md`,
then tailor it:

**orchestrator.md** — Add to Startup Protocol:
- The project's directory layout and where key code lives
- Available test commands and how to run them
- Any CI checks that must pass

**builder.md** — Customize the Process section with project specifics:
- Which test runner to use and the exact command (e.g., `pytest -xvs`, `npm test`)
- Which linter to run and the exact command (e.g., `npx eslint .`, `ruff check`)
- Where new code should go (directory conventions)
- Patterns to follow (e.g., "API routes go in `src/routes/`, each with a
  corresponding test in `tests/routes/`")
- Any build steps required before testing

**verifier.md** — Add project-relevant checks to Gate 2:
- Framework-specific concerns (e.g., "check for N+1 queries in Django ORM",
  "verify React hooks follow rules-of-hooks")
- Security patterns specific to this stack
- Test coverage expectations if the project has coverage tooling

**e2e-tester.md** — Configure for the project's test infrastructure:
- Which e2e framework is installed, where tests live, how to run them
- Key user flows in this application
- Test environment setup (dev server command, seed data)

**researcher.md** — Add project context:
- Key dependencies and where their docs live
- Architecture decisions visible in the code
- Where to look first for different types of questions

### Scenario B — Upgrade: Refresh Core, Keep Knowledge

For each of our 5 agents:
1. Read the existing `.claude/agents/{agent}.md`
2. Extract everything under `## Project-Specific Rules` and `## Learnings`
3. Also extract any project-specific customizations that were added to core
   sections (test commands, directory conventions, framework checks, etc.)
4. Read the latest template from `templates/{agent}.md`
5. Write the new template, re-applying ALL extracted customizations, rules,
   and learnings
6. Do NOT touch custom agent files that aren't part of our standard 5

### Scenario C — Fuse: Best of Both Worlds

When the project has agents that overlap with ours, the goal is to create a
unified agent that combines:
- **Their project knowledge**: custom instructions, conventions, domain expertise,
  accumulated learnings — things that took real sessions to figure out
- **Our structured workflow**: the build loop, output formats, retry protocol,
  two-gate verification, self-improvement system (learnings + bake-in)

**Fusion process for each overlapping agent:**

1. Read their existing agent file completely
2. Read our template for the same role
3. Identify what each brings:
   - **Theirs**: project-specific instructions, custom checks, domain knowledge,
     accumulated learnings, tool preferences, naming conventions
   - **Ours**: structured output format, retry protocol, self-improvement
     sections (Project-Specific Rules + Learnings), state machine integration
4. Write a fused agent that:
   - Keeps their core instructions and project knowledge as the foundation
   - Adds our structured sections: Output format, On Retry (builder), Gates
     (verifier), failure classification (e2e-tester)
   - Adds `## Project-Specific Rules` and `## Learnings` sections for the
     self-improvement system
   - Integrates with the orchestrator's state machine (uses our status codes:
     COMPLETE, NEEDS_CLARIFICATION, BLOCKED, APPROVED, CHANGES_REQUIRED, etc.)
5. Tell the user what you fused and what each side contributed

**For agents with no overlap** (custom agents like `deployer.md`, `michael.md`):
- Don't touch them
- Add `## Project-Specific Rules` and `## Learnings` sections to them so
  they can participate in the self-improvement system
- Register them in the orchestrator's Startup Protocol

**For our agents with no collision** (e.g., project has no verifier):
- Write our template with full customization (same as Scenario A)

### Agent templates:

| Template | When to create | Purpose |
|----------|---------------|---------|
| `templates/orchestrator.md` | Always | Coordinates build loops, dispatches to other agents |
| `templates/builder.md` | Always | Writes code, runs tests, reports changes |
| `templates/verifier.md` | Always | Two-gate review: spec compliance then code quality |
| `templates/e2e-tester.md` | If project has user-facing surfaces | End-to-end testing, failure classification |
| `templates/researcher.md` | If complex deps or large codebase | Pre-build investigation of APIs, patterns, docs |

---

## Step 4: Write State Files

### `.claude/gaps.md`

**Skip if `.claude/gaps.md` already exists** — it contains cross-session state.

Read `templates/gaps.md` and write to `.claude/gaps.md`.

### `.claude/progress.md`

**Skip if `.claude/progress.md` already exists** — it contains cross-session state.

Read `templates/progress.md` and write to `.claude/progress.md`.

---

## Step 5: Update CLAUDE.md

Append the following section to CLAUDE.md. Create the file if it doesn't exist.
**If a "Self-Improving Agent Harness" section already exists, update it rather
than duplicating it.**

Adapt the template below — list only the agents you actually created:

```markdown

## Self-Improving Agent Harness

Agents in `.claude/agents/`: [list the agents you created].
State files: `.claude/gaps.md` (blockers/decisions), `.claude/progress.md` (task tracking).

### Usage
- Start a build loop: "Use the orchestrator to build [goal]"
- Continue where you left off: "Use the orchestrator to continue"
- Bake learnings into agents: "Evolve the agents"
- Check open blockers: "Read .claude/gaps.md"
- Check progress: "Read .claude/progress.md"

### How It Works
1. Orchestrator reads agent learnings + state files, then decomposes goal into tasks
2. Each task cycles: RESEARCH? → BUILD → VERIFY → TEST with up to 3 retries
3. After 3 failures on a task, the orchestrator escalates to you with options
4. After each cycle, agents capture raw learnings in ## Learnings sections
5. After each build loop, the EVOLVE phase bakes validated learnings into agent instructions
6. Gaps and progress persist across sessions — the harness picks up where it left off
```

---

## Step 6: Report to User

1. List every file created, updated, fused, or skipped — with one-line explanation
2. For fused agents: explain what each side contributed
3. Highlight project-specific customizations applied (test commands, directory
   conventions, framework checks)
4. Show usage examples:
   - `Use the orchestrator to build [goal]`
   - `Use the orchestrator to continue`
   - `Evolve the agents` (bake validated learnings into agent instructions)
   - `Read .claude/gaps.md`
5. If $ARGUMENTS was provided: "Ready to start the first build loop with goal: **$ARGUMENTS**?"
6. If $ARGUMENTS was empty: "What would you like the agents to build?"
