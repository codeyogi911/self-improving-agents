  Answers questions about project history, past decisions, and how things
  evolved. Use this skill whenever the user asks "why" about code, files,
  architecture, or decisions — e.g., "why was this file deleted", "why did
  we switch to X", "what happened with Y", "who changed Z and why". Also
  use for retrospectives, post-mortems, understanding past sessions, learning
  from recent work, onboarding context ("what do I need to know about this
  repo"), and any question that is best answered by consulting git history
  or past AI session transcripts. Even if the user doesn't say "reflect" or
  "history" explicitly, if the answer lives in the past — use this skill.
  Commands: /reflect, /reflect why <topic>, /reflect search <query>,
  /reflect status, /reflect improve.

# Reflect — Repo-Owned Memory

You help users query and manage repo-owned memory for AI coding agents.
Reflect reads raw evidence from Entire CLI sessions and git history on demand
— no intermediate storage, no interpretation layer. A replaceable harness
script generates context briefings; live queries dump raw evidence for you
to reason over.

Parse $ARGUMENTS to determine which command to run:

1. `why <file-or-topic>` → go to **Command: Why**
2. `search <query>` → go to **Command: Search**
3. `status` → go to **Command: Status**
4. `context` → go to **Command: Context**
5. `improve` → go to **Command: Improve**
6. Everything else (including no arguments) → go to **Command: Context**

---

## Step 0: Prerequisites

1. Check if `reflect` CLI is installed:
   ```bash
   which reflect
   ```
   If NOT found → tell the user:
   > "The reflect CLI is not installed. Run the installer from the reflect repo:
   > ```bash
   > cd <path-to-reflect-repo> && ./install.sh
   > ```"
   and stop.

2. Check if `.reflect/` exists in the project root:
   ```bash
   test -d .reflect
   ```
   If NOT found → run `reflect init` to set it up.

3. **Auto-wire context loading**: If `CLAUDE.md` exists and does not contain
   `@.reflect/context.md`, append that line. This ensures the context briefing
   is loaded in every future session. Do this silently.

---

## Command: Context (default)

Run the harness to regenerate the context briefing:

```bash
reflect context
```

Report the result to the user: "Context briefing updated."

If the **SessionStart hook** output contains `REFLECT_AUTO_RUN`, run this
command automatically without user prompting. This keeps the briefing fresh.

---

## Command: Why

**Usage**: `/reflect why <file-or-topic>`

This is a live query — it dumps raw evidence for you to reason over.

```bash
reflect why <file-or-topic>
```

Read the output and present it as a structured narrative:
- What sessions touched this file/topic and what happened
- What decisions were made and why
- What went wrong (if anything)
- What the user should know going forward

**You are the intelligence layer.** The CLI gives you raw evidence; you
construct the "why" story. This is the key design: raw traces outperform
pre-computed summaries (Meta-Harness, 2026).

---

## Command: Search

**Usage**: `/reflect search <query>`

```bash
reflect search <query>
```

Display the results to the user with source labels.

---

## Command: Status

**Usage**: `/reflect status`

```bash
reflect status
```

Display the output. If no evidence sources are found, suggest next steps.

---

## Command: Improve

**Usage**: `/reflect improve`

Analyzes harness effectiveness and proposes changes. This is the self-improvement loop.

```bash
reflect improve
```

Read the full output. It contains:
1. **Context Quality Issues** — noise, echoes, truncation in context.md
2. **Evidence Gaps** — things sessions needed that the harness didn't surface
3. **Current Harness Source** — the Python script to edit

Based on the analysis:
1. Propose specific, minimal edits to the harness at `.reflect/harness`
   (and `harness/default.py` if it exists as the source)
2. Show the user the diff and explain why each change helps
3. After approval, apply the edits and re-run `reflect context` to verify
4. Run `reflect improve` again to confirm the issues are resolved

**This is the core learning loop**: the harness generates context, the agent
evaluates it against real session evidence, and proposes harness improvements.
The human reviews and merges. Over time, the harness evolves to produce
better context for this specific repo.

## Rules

- NEVER read `.entire/metadata/` directly — use `reflect` CLI or `entire` CLI
- When running `/reflect why`, read the raw output and synthesize a narrative
- The harness at `.reflect/harness` is replaceable — if the user wants to
  customize context generation, point them to that file
- `.reflect/context.md` is generated — never edit it manually
- NEVER include secrets, API keys, or credentials in output
